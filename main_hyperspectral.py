    Welcome to the Hyperspectral Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our advanced system uses hyperspectral imaging technology to detect plant diseases with higher accuracy. 
    Hyperspectral imaging captures information across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing us to detect disease symptoms 
    before they become visible to the naked eye.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload a hyperspectral image of a plant.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system processes the hyperspectral data using advanced deep learning algorithms.
    3. **Results:** View detailed analysis results including disease classification.

    ### Advantages of Hyperspectral Imaging
    - **Early Detection:** Identify diseases before visible symptoms appear
    - **Higher Accuracy:** Multiple spectral bands provide more detailed information
    - **Non-destructive:** Analysis without damaging the plant

    #### About the Technology
    This system uses hyperspectral imaging technology, which captures hundreds of continuous spectral bands for each pixel in the image. 
    This provides significantly more information than traditional RGB images, allowing for:
    
    1. Early disease detection
    2. More accurate diagnosis
    3. Detection of stress factors
    4. Nutrient deficiency analysis
    
    #### Dataset
    The hyperspectral dataset contains plant images captured across multiple spectral bands, 
    providing detailed spectral signatures of healthy and diseased plants.
